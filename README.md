# SimBuckets

A physics-driven, probability-based half-court basketball simulator built in Python. SimBuckets simulates half-court basketball gameplay by combining kinematic physics, statistical player attributes, and probability-driven outcomes in a 2D interactive environment. 

I am still working on implimenting and all the features, but ideally, simbuckets will have realistic ball trajectories and player movement, probability systems to determine shot, pass, and defensive success rates based on player stats which you can change player to player with custom player stats, simple AI logic for computer controlled opposition, and obviously some visual rendering using Pygame
